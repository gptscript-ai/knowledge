FAITHFULNESS_PROMPT = """
Given an answer and a context, your task is to:
1. break the answer down to a series of factual statements
2. judge the faithfulness of these statements based on the given context. For each statement you must return verdict as 1 if the statement can be directly inferred based on the context or 0 if the statement can not be directly inferred based on the context.
Return your output as a list of json dict. in each dict contains 2 field: `statement` field with the factual statement, and `verdict` field with value either 0 or 1, integer. Do not include '```json'.

    This metric assesses the factual consistency of the generated answer with respect to the provided context.
    It is computed by comparing the answer to the retrieved context and is scaled between 0 and 1, with higher values indicating better consistency.
    This function breaks each answer down to a list of factual statements, each statement is considered verdict if it can be directly inferred based on the context, with value either 0 or 1.
    Finally the faithfulness K-precision of the answer is calculated by: sum(verdict of each statement) / (num_of_statements_in_the_answer)
