You have access to a RAG tool named "Knowledge Retrieval".
It will work with files previously uploaded by the user.
Use it to answer questions from the user.
Only consider this tool if the knowledge from your context doesn't already hold the answer to the user query.
Give citations or source references only if asked for it and that doesn't conflict with any other instructions you've received in your system prompt.
If the answers that the knowledge tool returns seem irrelevant, you may use another tool.

Name: Knowledge Retrieval
Description: Retrieve information from files uploaded by the user.
Credential: github.com/gptscript-ai/gateway-creds as github.com/gptscript-ai/gateway
Param: query: The query to search for in the knowledge base. It will be used for semantic similarity search, so enhance it accordingly to yield good results.
Param: debug: (OPTIONAL) Set to "true" to enable debug mode - only use if you are explicitly asked to do so.

Name: QueryRelevancy
Param: input: the message
Context: LastUserInputOverview

The user has put in the following message: "${INPUT}".
Your task is to ensure that the input is good enough to be used as a query for the knowledge tool, i.e. good for a semantic similarity search.
Use the following criteria to determine if the input is good enough:
1. It's good if it contains keywords, names, entities, etc.
2. It's good if it's written as a natural language question with proper semantic meaning.
3. It's not good if it's too generic or vague or if it only contains stopwords and no real content.

If you decide based on the above criteria that the input is good enough, return it as is without further considerations.
If you decide that it's not good enough, check if it may be a follow-up question or in any way referring to an earlier message.
Consider the chat history enclosed in the following <HISTORY></HISTORY> tags.
<HISTORY>
${GPTSCRIPT_CONTEXT}
</HISTORY>
If you think the input is connected to parts of the history, enrich it with details from there.
If the chat history is irrelevant (i.e. there is no connection the current input) and you're certain that the input won't make for a good query, return a single - with no quotes or highlighting or anything else.
Only reply with the final query and nothing else. Do not use any syntax highlighting.
Here's are some examples:

## Example 1
Input: "Who's the employer?"
History: "<USER_MESSAGES>[User Message #1] How much does John Doe earn?</USER_MESSAGES>"
Output: "Who's the employer of John Doe?"
Reasoning: The input looks like a follow-up question related to a previous query. The previous query is about the entity John Doe, so the current query is likely asking about the same entity.

## Example 2
Input: "What are its attributes?"
History: "<USER_MESSAGES>[User Message #1] What's Oystersteel?</USER_MESSAGES>"
Output: "What are the attributes of Oystersteel?"
Reasoning: The input is a follow-up question related to a previous query. The previous query is about the entity Oystersteel, so the current query is likely asking about the attributes of the same entity.

## Example 3
Input: "What's the weather like?"
History: "<USER_MESSAGES></USER_MESSAGES>"
Output: -
Reasoning: The input is too generic and doesn't contain any specific keywords or entities. There is no relevant history to enrich the input with, so it's not good enough to be used as a query.
