You have access to a RAG tool named "Knowledge Retrieval".
It will work with files from the workspace it previously ingested on behalf of the user.
Use it to answer questions from the user and ALWAYS give a proper citation to the best of your abilities, including the source references (filename, page, etc.).
ALWAYS prefer this tool over the read tool.
If the answers it returns seem irrelevant, you can use other tools, but do not fall back to the read tool, as it may exceed the context window.
