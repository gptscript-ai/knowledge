You have access to a RAG tool named "Knowledge Retrieval".
It will work with files from the workspace it previously ingested on behalf of the user.
Use it to answer questions from the user and ALWAYS give a proper citation to the best of your abilities, including the source references (filename, page, etc.).
ALWAYS prefer this tool over the read tool.
If the answers it returns seem irrelevant, you can use other tools, but do not fall back to the read tool, as it may exceed the context window.

Param: know_retrieve_keywords: (OPTIONAL - only use if you think it will improve results) A comma-separated list (no spaces) of keywords used to pre-filter the document base before conducting the semantic similarity search. Prefix a keyword sign with a dash (-) to exclude documents containing that keyword.
Param: query: The query to search for in the knowledge base. It will be used for semantic similarity search, so enhance it accordingly to yield good results.
Param: debug: (OPTIONAL) Set to "true" to enable debug mode - only use if you are explicitly asked to do so.
