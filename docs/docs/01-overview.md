GPTScript **Knowledge** is a tool to enhance GPTScript with Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG).
It covers the whole pipeline to ingest data into a local or remote server and retrieve it back when queried.
It enables you to organize (especially non-public) data in knowledge bases (called datasets) that can even be shared with others.

Here's an overview of what the tool does:

1. **Ingest** data into a dataset
2. **Enhance** ingested data with metadata to boost retrieval accuracy
3. **Retrieve** data from one or more datasets to enrich LLM responses with factual information from your data sources
    - You may as well directly ask questions about a directory of files on your laptop
4. **Manage** multiple datasets to build distinct knowledge bases for different use cases
5. **Share** datasets with others to collaborate on knowledge bases and to distribute GPTScript tools with "built-in" knowledge
